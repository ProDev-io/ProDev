## lazysizes
lazysizes is a fast (jank-free), SEO-friendly and self-initializing lazyloader for images (including responsive images picture/srcset), iframes, scripts/widgets and much more. It also prioritizes resources by differentiating between crucial in view and near view elements to make perceived performance even faster.

It may become also your number one tool to integrate responsive images. It can automatically calculate the sizes attribute for your responsive images, it allows you to share media queries for your media attributes with your CSS, helping to separate layout (CSS) from content/structure (HTML) and it makes integrating responsive images into any environment really simple. It also includes a set of optional plugins to further extend its functionality.

Install lazysizes using npm:
```html
npm install lazysizes
```
